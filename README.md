# Brightness Controller MOD
This is an unofficial and modified version of <b>Brightness Controller</b> for my TF101 running PostMarketOS (the program can also run in other devices). The original code is distributed by Amit Seal Ami (https://github.com/LordAmit/Brightness), and this one is distributed by Antoni Aloy Torrens. 
It uses `xbacklight` from `acpilight` (https://gitlab.com/wavexx/acpilight) to control brightness instead of `xrandr` (because sometimes it cannot detect screen).
